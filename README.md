# This website is to demonstrate my web-dev skills, expect this website to change as I'm continuously learning new developing techniques, mainly, nodeJS, MongoDB, and Express!

# Some of techniques shown here are Authentication using PassportJS, Authorization using req.user, body-parser to parse data from our forms, RESTful Routes, Cloudinary to store our images using an in-browser upload feature, a cloud database using mongolab as well as others I haven't mentioned!

# expect v2 of this project to have password reset feature using nodemailer and crypto tokens, in addition to some styling changes!
